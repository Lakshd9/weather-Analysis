Weather Analysis 

This project involves analyzing weather and air quality data using SQL. It covers a variety of analytical queries to gain insights into temperature trends, humidity levels, wind speeds, air quality indices, and more.

Features
- Analyze weather patterns (temperature, wind, precipitation).
- Monitor air quality (PM2.5, PM10, CO, Ozone, etc.).
- Aggregate and filter data by region, country, and time.
- Create views for reusable insights.
- Perform ranking, grouping, and advanced filtering.

Dataset Highlights
- **Columns**: Location, temperature (°C/°F), wind speed (mph/kph), air quality metrics, humidity, UV index, and more.
- **Applications**: Environmental monitoring, trend analysis, and dashboard integration.

Key SQL Queries
- Average temperature by region or country.
- Top locations by UV index or wind speed.
- Filtering locations based on air quality thresholds.
- Date and time-based analysis for sunrise, sunset, and updates.
